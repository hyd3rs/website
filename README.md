# hyd3rs v13
Woops, this one was a [bit early](https://github.com/hyd3rs/website/releases/tag/12.0.0), but it's time for a refresh again! This project serves to prove my design and development standards, and I periodically refresh danny.works every so often in order to reflect my growth.


## What's in this repository?
As always, this is a monorepo. Unlike last time, I'm using Turborepo, but the frontend's the only thing in here for now.

Currently, Anemo (the backend API for v11, v12, and now v13.0) powers dynamic data - for now, that's the music widget. This will likely change in the future; I'm not sure when I'll have time to do this, but the new backend API will be included here when it's ready (in Gleam or Go, perhaps?).

## Retrospective
This one took much longer than any of my previous ones - I've been sitting on this new codebase since January, but I spent the latter half of March polishing this project and architecting a viable system for [**the corner**](https://hyders.dev/corner). As such, I won't waste the opportunity and I'll eventually release a full retrospective (and possible dev log?) on the development of this site on there.

If I remember, I'll update this README with a link to that when I've written it.
